/**
 * BST DS offers the search benefits of a sorted array as well as inserting and
 * deleting benefits of linked list. Excellent for inserting, deleting and
 * searching. Anything to the left of root or a node will be less than the node
 * and anything to the right of the node will be greater than the node. If we
 * try to insert same value as that of a node then it goes to the left of the
 * node by default behaviour. The Complexity of BST is O(log n). For this to
 * achieve the BST must be 'Balanced'. Balanced : For all the nodes, the
 * difference between the heights of the left and the right subtrees must not be
 * greater than 1.
