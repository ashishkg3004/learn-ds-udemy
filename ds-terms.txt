Terms:
======
Liners        : The operation will run the no of elements in the array.
Constant Time : The operation will run only once regardless of size.
Quadratic	  : The operation will run the size of the array squared times.

Growth rates:
=============
Linear    = Single Loop.
Quadratic = Loop inside of loop. [Nested loop]

Asymptotic Notation:
====================
To communicate the efficiency of an algorithm we use some shorthand notation called Asymptotic notation. 
This shows how well the algorithm scales. It depends upon n(size of the input).

Linear Growth Rate      : O(n)		[Single Loop]
Quadratic Growth Rate   : O(n^2)	[Loop inside Loop]
Constant Growth Rate    : O(1)		[Single Time]
Cubic Growth Rate 	    : O(n^3)    [Loop inside loop inside loop]
Exponential Growth Rate : O(n^n)    [ex: Matrix Supply Chain Multiplication]

The term 'Complexities' is often used for Growth Rate or efficiency of an algorithm.
